Welcome for using NetTopo simulator!

NetTopo is an open source research-oriented simulator designed to test and validate algorithms for wireless sensor networks.

The goal of NetTopo is to build a sensor network simulating tool that gives users extraordinary flexibility to simulate their own algorithms and is a compelling replacement of commercial simulator focusing on visualization of the communication in the real wireless sensor network test bed.
